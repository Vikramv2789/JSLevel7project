 Project: Connect Four

Project Overview: 
The site displays a 8 to 9 grid. A user who uses the site should be able to place a sky blue or brown(any color works) chip into the grid, and if there are four of the same colored chips in a row vertically, horizontally, and diagonally, the user should be told that they have won the game, based on the color they have. 

Display: 
Just a grid needs to be shown(8 by 9), with circles inside them, denoting spaces that chips can fill. Background color must be different from the grid. A title should be included at the top, along with a set of rules on how to play the game. 

One player should have a sky blue chip while the other should have a brown chip. Each person will have the ability to click on any column they want. When a column is clicked, the chip will go down to the lowest empty point on the board for that column.

Functionality:
A red, blank grid should show on the website  As stated before, there will be a skyblue chip and a brown chip. Each person will have one click, and they cannot take back the move once it's made. The game will continue as long as there are not four of the same colored chips in a row horizontally, diagonally or vertically. There should be a winner in this game since it is larger than the average connected four game board, a 6 by 7 grid. 

Enhancements: 
There are a few(not included in mine, however):
 
Change the game to a connected five by using a larger grid. Same rules of vertical, horizontal and diagonal to win, however, five chips need to be connected, instead of the four in my game. 

Use a “trap”, so if there are three chips that are about to be connected, 20% of the time, the program will randomly generate a chip that is neither brown or sky blue, but blocks the potential fourth chip from being placed to win the game. 

Program:

Knowing how to program arrays are essential
